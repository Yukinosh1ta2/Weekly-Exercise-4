Civic technology (often “civic tech”) refers to digital tools that strengthen the relationship between governments and the people they serve. Examples include open-data portals, participatory budgeting websites, reporting apps for local issues, and online consultation platforms. Its main goal is to improve transparency, accountability, and citizen participation. While “GovTech” focuses on improving government operations internally, civic tech emphasizes giving residents a stronger voice in decision-making (Govocal, 2018; UNDP Asia-Pacific, 2025).

Smart Cities use sensors, data, and digital infrastructure to manage urban services such as traffic, energy, and public safety. Civic tech helps ensure these systems remain citizen-centered. First, open-data dashboards and real-time reporting apps make services transparent, which builds public trust and allows outside developers or civic hackers to design local solutions (Data-Smart City Solutions, 2018). Second, participatory platforms give residents input into policies and budgets, ensuring projects reflect real community needs (OECD, 2024). Research on Smart City programs finds that citizen participation improves legitimacy and outcomes, especially when co-creation methods are used (Leclercq et al., 2022).

Civic tech also improves responsiveness. Apps that let residents report potholes or outages feed directly into municipal systems, speeding up repairs and resource allocation. In addition, civic hacking initiatives—where volunteers build apps using city data—generate creative solutions to challenges like mobility, safety, or environmental monitoring (UNDP Asia-Pacific, 2025). Finally, civic tech helps address equity by ensuring marginalized groups are included in Smart City decision-making (Landa Oregi et al., 2025).

In summary, Smart Cities benefit from civic technology by becoming more transparent, participatory, and responsive. Rather than just deploying technology for efficiency, cities that integrate civic tech create inclusive, people-driven governance that strengthens trust and improves quality of life.
